**Template Files:**

Template files, are used to generate dynamic HTML content that can change based on user input or data from the application. Here's why we need template files:

- **Dynamic Content:** Template files allow you to generate HTML pages with dynamic content. You can embed placeholders, known as template variables, which are filled with data when the page is rendered.

- **Reusable Layouts:** Templates enable you to define a layout structure for your web pages and reuse it across multiple views. This promotes consistency in the appearance of your site.

- **Separation of Logic and Presentation:** Templates separate the logic (handled in Python code) from the presentation (handled in HTML templates). This separation makes it easier for developers to focus on their respective tasks.

- **Conditional Rendering:** Templates support conditional statements and loops, allowing you to generate different HTML structures based on application logic.

- **Inheritance:** Flask uses a concept called template inheritance, where you can create a base template with a common layout and extend it in child templates. This promotes code reusability and consistency.

In summary, static files are essential for serving resources like styles, scripts, and images efficiently, while template files enable the dynamic generation of HTML content based on application data and user interactions. The combination of both static and template files helps create interactive, performant, and maintainable web applications with Flask.
